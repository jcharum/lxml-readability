The negotiators sat down for another round of talks at the White House on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>In an <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20078789-503544.html">interview with CBS News</a>, Mr. Obama said he &#8220;cannot guarantee&#8221; that the government can pay benefits next month to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" class="tickerized" title="More articles about Social Security.">Social Security</a> recipients, veterans and the disabled if Congress does not increase the federal debt limit, raising the political stakes even as Republicans hardened their opposition to him.</p><p>Mr. McConnell&#8217;s proposal would give Mr. Obama sweeping power to increase the government&#8217;s borrowing authority, in increments, by up to $2.4 trillion &#8212; enough, it is estimated, to cover federal obligations through next year &#8212; only if Mr. Obama specifies spending cuts of equal amounts. But Congress would not have to approve the spending cuts prior to the debt-limit increase.</p><p>It is not clear whether House Republicans would sign on to such a measure, given their drive to extract deep spending cuts in return for any debt-limit increase. <span id="more-157931"/></p><p>Mr. McConnell, who after the midterm elections last November said Republicans&#8217; goal would be to make Mr. Obama a one-term president, said in his Senate speech, &#8220;After years of discussions and months of negotiations, I have little question that as long as this president is in the Oval Office, a real solution is probably unattainable.&#8221;</p><p>At the White House, press secretary <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/jay_carney/index.html?inline=nyt-per" class="tickerized" title="More articles about Jay Carney.">Jay Carney</a> responded, &#8220;This president&#8217;s going to be in office for at least another 18 months, and I think the American people expect Congress to work with him.&#8221;</p><p>With the Aug. 2 deadline for raising the government&#8217;s $14.3 trillion debt limit just three weeks away, Tuesday seemed to mark a new low in the summer&#8217;s maneuvering between the White House and Congressional Republicans to agree to a debt-reduction package that would clear the way for a vote on the debt limit. The back-and-forth had people in both parties nervously eyeing the financial markets, fretful that the political fighting would unnerve them; to date, Wall Street has been generally complacent that the White House and Congress ultimately would come to an agreement, if only because failing to do so would hold such economic peril.</p><p>Representatives of major business groups, including the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/chamber_of_commerce_us/index.html?inline=nyt-org" class="tickerized" title="More articles about the United States Chamber of Commerce.">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> and the Business Roundtable, put out public statements urging a bipartisan accord on raising the debt limit.

Bloomberg</a> opened an unrelated event on Tuesday morning by saying, &#8220;If America, for the first time in its history, defaults on its obligations, it would have a catastrophic effect on our financial system and on our credibility around the world.
